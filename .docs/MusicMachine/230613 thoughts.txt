eh yeh
i don't describe my thoughts that much in it

sigh
it's kind of the same thing from DES203
kinda... not that much though
idk

yeh
my brain was just too inside DES310
and not enough time to get out of it
so I couldn't think of what to say

what was that thing I said in it
something about how everything I could say i had already said in my DES310 portfolio
yeh that illustrates it

the fact i had no time, so I just hand wave to my DES310 portfolio
and the fact i couldn't stop thinking of DES310

========
So what do I think now

Well I think that I could see that I wanted in that
Sound shapes
But knew there was not enough time
So I was gonna make a Music Machine

And during that yeh
I spend too much time doing these little programming things
Making it all nice and working

When I should've just prototyped

It's hard with these things though
It's hard to look at my design process and think how to improve it
I can see that I wasted time
But then when you ask yourself what gave you the good idea you have now
It's like, well? I don't know.

Game Jams
Dissonance
Frustration

That's where they seem to come from
But not always

But I guess a part of the process, is just making sure you don't waste time on those bad ideas
That you need to get yourself in that worried realistation that it doesn't work
So that the next idea comes to you

I think the main thing is, yeh.
I get too into programming. Too into making everything good and structured.
Too into my character controllers.
When I need to just prototype.
