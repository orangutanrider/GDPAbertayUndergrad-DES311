Aim:
To gain an understanding of music production  
And
To investigate the practices behind designing and producing good UX.

Objectives:

Research virtual instruments and performance in games, in relation to ux.
	Compare against music production software and composer workflows.

Create a prototype game in Unity, that allows for musical performance.

Produce and record live performance song, by using the game, and improve the ux of the game through  that production.

Evaluate the fun and usability of game, and reflect on the project as a whole.

Skills Gaps

UI design and integration
Gamer's Brain book, but did bad

Music production

Win? End?

========
A game.

A live video recording of a song being made in the game.

And
a PDP
That shows:
Research notes
Technical jargin that I find noteworthy
Iterations of the song and the process for creating it  Iterations on the instruments and systems in the game  Inspiration
My reflections
And an evaluation of the project

My concerns

Audio programming
It may be a technical challenge
