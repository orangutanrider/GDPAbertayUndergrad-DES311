========
Aim:
To gain an understanding of music theory and the practice of making music for games.  And
To investigate the practices behind designing and producing UI for desktop games.

And I hope to do both of these things by creating UI and Music for my personal project.  Which is a game that's attempting to adapt the gameplay of devil daggers to an rts format.

========
Objectives:
Gain and demonstrate an understanding of basic music theory and a further understanding of music in games.  Research composer workflows and create interactive music for the gameplay, and menus of my project.

Research the practices and workflows of UI designers and design and implement UI for my project.

Reflect and evaluate the usability of the game's interfaces and how well the music meshes with the  gameplay.

========
Skills Gaps

UI design and integration
I've read most of The Gamer's Brain book, but I'm bad at making UI

Music production
I essentially know nothing about music

I hope to gain a better understanding of these fields so I can gain a more wholistic understanding of  how games get made.

========
I don't aim to finish the game that i'm adding UI and Music too.

I don't aim for this because I don't think I'd be able to get it to the level of quality I'm looking for  with the time I have.

I'm looking to make UI for the following
A HUD for the gameplay
A pause screen
A start menu - reference to gamepack (haunted ps1)  And a settings menu

For the settings I'm atleast looking to have all the controls re-mappable
But I'm unsure as to how far I could go with the settings as the game won't be finished

For the music I'm looking to make something pretty detailed and complex for the gameplay  And something more calm and simple for the menus

========
So deliverables

1.
The Unity project with

All the UI I mentioned implemented in Unity
And the music but with limited interactivity due to the un-finished state of the game


2.
I'll provide all the files for the music
(which will include the interactive elements that possibley ended up not being implemented)

3.
And finally a PDP that details the following:
How the music's interactive elements will work in the final game  The vision for the completed game
A demonstration of the UI's functionality  And my research notes

========
My concerns

There is a split between the UI and Music elements
Though the project addresses both of them it does so by individually addressing each of them  
They're seperated

And I think this makes scoping and time management more difficult
