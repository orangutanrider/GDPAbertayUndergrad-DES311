# My DES311 Work
DES311 was a game design practice module at abertay, in the GDP undergrad course I was in, taught by: 

Lynn Love l.love@abertay.ac.uk, Mona Bozdog m.bozdog@abertay.ac.uk, and Sandy Tarvet a.tarvet@abertay.ac.uk

It was a research project, I was introduced to strategic thinking. We were tasked with coming up with a creative project, in the interest of improving skill deficits, that we had self identified. Extracts from the official description can be found below.

## Module Description
### Aims
The aim of this module is provide students with the opportunity to undertake advanced independent study in a defined area of game design practice, with a view to developing relevant creative, technical, and professional skills.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module the student should be able to :
1. Research contemporary areas of game design practice, identifying roles, responsibilities, required skills, and relevant bodies of knowledge.
2. Identify an area of personal interest within the field of game design, and devise a personal development plan founded upon a skills audit
3. Undertake a specialist project following self-directed tutorials and reading, leading to the generation of a portfolio of new game design work
4. Demonstrate the ability to assess and communicate one-s own development, and to devise effective strategies for ongoing personal improvement

## My Project
Details on the project at the time can be found in .docs

My project was mostly centered around a game that you'd make music in. I never got any of my ideas to a playable enough state though. There're multiple unity projects because I pivoted my idea a few times, still they all centered around this idea of creating music inside a game. My intention was that I'd improve my music skills by creating a game that I could produce music in.

### My thoughts 240110
Most of the time was spent improving my planning and programming skills; I learnt a lot but I didn't produce anything. It's disheartening that I don't have any completed product to play and look back on, but skills wise I think I improved the most from this, out of any other module. My original intention was to learn music, but my project wasn't well suited to this; I was having too much fun with programming so I just kept doing it. If I had really wanted to learn music I should've narrowed my scope, but at the time I had a hard time letting go of the ideas I had. At the time, I didn't really understand what a research project was. I could see that I had the opportunity to just make something that I wanted to, but I was also aware that the purpose of the module was more complex than that. I had a hard time comprehending what the module wanted me to do. My project ended up being, more something that I thought would be cool, than something that I thought I would learn Music from. Of course it wasn't all a loss, I still learned a lot, I just didn't learn in the area I set out to learn in. I'd also say that I was maybe too optimistic in my game ideas, because I'd build-up the groundwork for them before testing them, every time. 

Thinking of myself now, I still have too much fun with the programming, but I think I'm much more aware of what a research project is; I'm glad for that, because I think research projects are pretty important to making any mildly large sized games, and improving your skills. What I think I maybe haven't improved that much on is time-management; I think I do a good job with planning and focus, but I tend to avoid time-management. Prototyping is still not something I do super often, but I also don't have to come up with game ideas super often either; Considering that I was kind-of just making a game, and struggling with ideas, I'd probably look to do game jams now, to prove something before going with it. Still though, I'm not sure where that kind-of thing sits in a research project.

A thing I wanna mention too is that after DES311 I spent a lot of time making tools for myself in Unity and C#, during the holidays; I wouldn't say it was all a waste, I'm not against using my Unity and C# skills, but yeah, for my personal projects I will be using either Godot or Bevy. I say this because I was really excited about the tools I was making for myself, the fact that I've just had to abandon them feels like such a waste; I almost still want to make them, even if I'm not going to use them myself.
